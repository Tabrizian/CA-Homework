                    Because it's denser than DRAM, we can store more information
                    in it than DRAM. (And also Because it's price is the same.)

                    The problem of the low speed can be solved by using this
                    hierarchy, but the problem of limitations of writing won't
                    be solved by using this hierarchy because the memory hierarchy
                    only solves the problems caused by more speed with great cost
                    and less cost with less speed memories. But this problem will
                    not be solved by using this hierarchy.
